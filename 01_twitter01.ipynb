    "In order to collect data from Twitter, you first need to register a new *application* &mdash; this is Twitter's way of referring to any computer program that interacts with the Twitter API. As long as you save your registration information correctly, you should only need to do this once, since the information should work for any NLTK code that you write. You will need to have a Twitter account before you can register. Twitter also insists that [you add a mobile phone number to your Twitter profile](https://support.twitter.com/articles/110250-adding-your-mobile-number-to-your-account-via-web) before you will be allowed to register an application.\n",

    "3. Go to the tab labeled **Keys and Access Tokens**. It should look something like this, but with actual keys rather than a string of Xs:\n",

    "As you can see, this will give you four distinct keys: consumer key, consumer key secret, access token and access token secret."
